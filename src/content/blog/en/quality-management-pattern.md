Industries such as **healthcare**, **energy**, **aviation**, and other
safety-critical sectors require stringent **quality management** protocols to
ensure the safety of their operations. In these environments, failure to adhere
to quality protocols can have serious consequences.

**`surveilr`** is a powerful tool for quality management organizations tasked
with collecting and auditing data to ensure that staff are following proper
protocols. By aggregating data from disparate systems and auditing logs or
records, `surveilr` makes it easier to verify that proper safety and quality
processes are in place. Whether for internal audits, external regulatory
reviews, or continuous quality improvement, `surveilr` helps ensure that
critical operations adhere to the highest standards.
