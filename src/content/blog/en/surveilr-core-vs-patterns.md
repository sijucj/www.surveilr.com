At the heart of **`surveilr`** is the flexibility to adapt to a wide range of
industries, disciplines, and use cases. This adaptability is enabled through a
combination of the **`surveilr` Core** engine and a modular approach to
**Patterns**.

## `surveilr` Core

`surveilr` Core is the core engine, a single binary that handles the heavy
lifting of collecting, aggregating, and processing evidence data. While
incredibly powerful, `surveilr` Core itself is **agnostic to specific use
cases** and does not have built-in awareness of business needs. It’s a flexible
tool designed to work with many different data sources and workflows.

## `surveilr` Patterns

This flexibility comes to life through **`surveilr` Patterns**, which are
**web-based libraries** of **SQL Packages** that can be mixed and matched to
extend the functionality of `surveilr` Core. These Patterns fall into several
categories:

- **Universal Patterns**: Designed to apply across all industries, such as
  general compliance tracking, security monitoring, or operational auditing.
  These are foundational packages that can be useful in any organizational
  context.

- **Industry Patterns**: Tailored to the needs of specific sectors, such as
  **healthcare**, which may require managing **EHR data** for HIPAA compliance,
  or **finance**, which might need specialized handling of **ERP data** to meet
  SOX standards. These packages provide industry-specific workflows and file
  formats.

- **Discipline Patterns**: These focus on the needs of specific professional
  roles or functions, such as **software engineers**, **QA teams**, **regulatory
  compliance officers**, and **cybersecurity professionals**. For example, a
  Discipline Pattern for **cybersecurity** professionals might automate threat
  detection, security log aggregation, and incident reporting, while a
  Discipline Pattern for **QA** might focus on quality tracking and product
  lifecycle management.

## Service Patterns

In addition to Universal, Industry, and Discipline Patterns, `surveilr` also
offers **Service Patterns**, which provide a **self-contained, highly
opinionated application or service** for specific use cases. A **Service
Pattern** is a culmination of **Universal**, **Industry**, and **Discipline**
Patterns, blended together to form a complete solution that can operate as a
standalone service.

For example, a **Healthcare Security Compliance Service Pattern** might combine
**Universal Patterns** for security monitoring, an **Industry Pattern** for
handling **EHR data**, and a **Discipline Pattern** designed for **regulatory
compliance** officers. The result is a full-service application that can be
deployed with minimal configuration, offering a focused solution that meets the
needs of healthcare organizations looking to secure patient data and comply with
regulatory standards.

## Composability and Flexibility

`surveilr` Patterns are delivered as **composable SQL Packages**, allowing
organizations to customize their use of `surveilr` by selecting the appropriate
Patterns for their needs. For example, a financial services company could
combine a **Universal Pattern** for compliance reporting with an **Industry
Pattern** specific to finance, and add a **Discipline Pattern** for software
engineers to track system performance.

## Benefits of the `surveilr` Core + Patterns Strategy

- **Flexibility**: With the ability to choose from Universal, Industry,
  Discipline, and Service Patterns, organizations can customize `surveilr` to
  meet their exact requirements without modifying the Core engine.

- **Efficiency**: Service Patterns provide a ready-to-use, opinionated solution
  that is designed to be deployed quickly for specific applications, reducing
  the need for manual setup or configuration.

- **Scalability**: As business needs evolve, new Patterns can be added or
  existing ones modified without disrupting existing workflows, making
  `surveilr` scalable and adaptable over time.

- **Comprehensive Use Case Support**: Whether an organization needs basic
  compliance tracking or a full-service application, `surveilr` Patterns offer
  the flexibility to create complex solutions from individual components.

With the combination of **`surveilr` Core** and the modular **Patterns**
approach—including **Universal**, **Industry**, **Discipline**, and **Service
Patterns**—`surveilr` enables organizations to confidently prove **security**,
**quality**, and **compliance** with **auditable**, **queryable**, and
**machine-attestable evidence** while scaling and adapting to specific needs.
