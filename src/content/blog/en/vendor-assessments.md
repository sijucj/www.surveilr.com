In industries where supply chain partners are involved—such as healthcare,
energy, and cybersecurity—vendors must often evaluate and police each other’s
policy adherence. **`surveilr`** enables companies to do just that in a secure
and efficient way.

With **`surveilr`**, you can collect **policy adherence evidence** directly from
systems behind corporate firewalls. Sensitive data can be anonymized or removed
entirely, allowing organizations to share just the evidence required to prove
compliance without exposing proprietary or personal information. This is
particularly valuable in **vendor assessments**, where transparency is
essential, but security and privacy cannot be compromised.

Corporate compliance leaders and cybersecurity officers can also use
**`surveilr`** to gather data anonymously or with attribution, depending on the
need. Whether through automated processes or manual reviews, `surveilr` allows
organizations to enforce or audit policy adherence by capturing activities
across systems and verifying whether individuals or teams are following
established procedures. By pulling data from emails, lifecycle tools like
GitHub, SaaS platforms, or logs, **`surveilr`** provides a clear picture of
whether key standards are being met.
