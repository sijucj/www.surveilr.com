### What are Work Product Artifacts ( WPAs) ?

WPAs or Machine attestation artifacts are digital proofs collected from various
automated sources to ensure compliance with security, privacy, safety, and
regulatory policies. These artifacts include data from code repositories, test
results, emails, issues/tickets, wikis, and other documentation. Tools like
Opsfolio's Surveilr agent gather these artifacts to verify adherence to policies
without burdening professionals with manual documentation tasks. This approach
streamlines the compliance process by leveraging existing work products as
evidence.
