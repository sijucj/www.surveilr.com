**`Resource Surveillance State Database`** is a SQLite database generated by the
Surveilr tool, which can be used independently to provide machine-attested
evidence of compliance and security across various work products and disciplines
within an organization. This helps overcome the limitations of human-based
compliance verification processes.

## Characteristics of a RSSD

- **Independence**: Once the RSSD is generated, it is no longer tied to
  `surveilr` and can be used by any other tool, service, application, or ETL'd
  into a data warehouse which makes it a versatile data source.

- **Consumption**: It can be consumed by any computing environment that supports
  `SQLite` , allowing it to be integrated into various systems and workflows

- **Evidence Collection**: It is designed to collect machine attestation
  artifacts like code, test results, emails, issues/tickets, and wikis to prove
  that security, privacy, safety and regulatory compliance policies are being
  followed. This provides a more reliable and automated way to demonstrate
  compliance compared to relying on human attestation.

## How to generate an RSSD

Generating a `RSSD` requires you to execute a `survielr ingest` command which
can either be [file ingestion](/docs/core/cli/ingest-commands/files) or
[task ingestion](/docs/core/cli/ingest-commands/tasks). Suppose you have folder
named `my-files` and it is located within your current working directory, you
can ingest the files in this folder by navigating into the folder ( `cd` ), and
executing this script:

```bash
$ surveilr ingest files
```

An `RSSD` will be created inside `my-files`

if you prefer not `cd` into `my-files` before performing file ingestion, there
is a `-r` flag that allows you to specify `my-files` as the folder you wish to
ingest its content(s) without having to leave your root directory.

```bash
$ surveilr ingest files -r <PATH>/my-files
```

The outcome of the execution of this script above is a
`resource-surveillance.sqlite.db` file ( known as
`resource surveillance state database - RSSD` ) created in your root directory.
The database consist of several tables which can you can learn about
[here](/docs/standard-library/rssd-schema/state_schema#tables).

## Configuring Unique Identifiers for RSSD Databases

`surveilr` uses a default SQLite database named
`resource-surveillance.sqlite.db` for storing file system state data. However,
in environments with multiple surveillance databases, it's beneficial to
distinguish each `RSSD` by including unique identifiers in the filename, such as
the hostname. This setup simplifies [merging](/docs/core/admin/merge)
of databases. Unique identifiers can be configured for `RSSD` databases in two
ways:

1. **Using an environment variable**: During a terminal session, you can set a
   custom `RSSD` path as an environment variable. This path will serve as an
   identifier for the generated SQLite database during ingestion. Note that the
   environment variable will be cleared once the terminal session is closed.

   ```bash
   export SURVEILR_STATEDB_FS_PATH="resource-surveillance-$(hostname).sqlite.db"
   ```
   :::note[Note]
   - `SURVEILR_STATEDB_FS_PATH` can take the path you want the `RSSD` to be
     stored as value
     (`SURVEILR_STATEDB_FS_PATH="<path>/resource-surveillance-$(hostname).sqlite.db"`).
     If a path isn't specified, the `RSSD` will be stored in the current working
     directory.
   - `SURVEILR_STATEDB_FS_PATH` can take any string as the identifier as long it
     has `.db` extension (`SURVEILR_STATEDB_FS_PATH="my-identifier.db"`). :::

2. **Argument Passing**: When performing an ingestion, you need to set the
   `RSSD`'s unique identifier by passing it as an argument with the `-d` flag,
   as shown below.

   ```bash
   $ surveilr ingest files -d "resource-surveillance-$(hostname).sqlite.db"
   ```
